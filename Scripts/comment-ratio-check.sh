# comment-ratio-check.sh: flag Swift files where comment lines outnumber code
# lines, as a signal for a human to look, not a fail.
#
# Part of the ecosystem's code-style policy (see
# docs/code-style-policy-proposal-2026-08.md in the `ecosystem` repo for the
# full rationale). A high ratio is sometimes legitimate (a small function with
# several real caveats worth spelling out) and sometimes means a doc comment
# has drifted into restating design rationale that belongs in docs/ instead:
# this script surfaces the number, it doesn't judge which case it is.
# Report-only: always exits 0, same as OCCTSwift's own `check-docs-existence.py`
# `--coverage` mode, and for the same reason: failing every file above a
# threshold on day one, in a codebase nobody has swept yet, punishes the report
# instead of the problem.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/comment-ratio-check.sh              # default threshold: 1.0
#   Scripts/comment-ratio-check.sh 1.5           # custom threshold
